o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
I believe data structures and algorithms are essential for managing large inventories effectively. When handling thousands of products, I need to be able to quickly search for specific items, update their quantities or prices, and ensure the system can scale as the inventory grows. By choosing the right data structure, I can make these operations fast and efficient. On the other hand, using the wrong structure could slow everything down and create unnecessary bottlenecks.

o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
When designing my inventory system, I carefully consider which data structures to use based on the kind of operations I need to perform. I often choose a `Dictionary<int, Product>` because it allows me to quickly look up, update, or delete products by their ID with minimal effort. If I need to iterate over the products in order or handle simpler tasks, I might use a `List<Product>`, though I know lookups will be slower since it’s O(n). For more advanced scenarios—like when I need to maintain sorted order or find minimum and maximum values efficiently—I turn to structures like binary search trees or heaps. I avoid using plain arrays or basic lists for large-scale systems where fast lookup is critical, as they can quickly become a performance bottleneck.

TIME COMPLEXITY
When it comes to performing operations on my inventory system, I rely on a Dictionary because it offers excellent performance for common tasks. Adding a product is a constant-time operation, taking O(1), which means no matter how many products I have, inserting a new one is always fast. Updating an existing product is just as efficient, also O(1), since I can directly access it using its productId created. Deleting a product works the same way—quick and reliable with O(1) time complexity. When I want to display the entire inventory, I use Dictionary.Values, which lets me iterate over all products in O(n) time, where n is the number of items. This balance of speed and simplicity is why I prefer dictionaries for managing inventory operations.

only one idea that comes up in my mind to optimize it more is to use serialization (JSON/XML) to persist and reload inventory data. inhave studied it during web development and can be used here in this scenario to make it more optimized to work on.
