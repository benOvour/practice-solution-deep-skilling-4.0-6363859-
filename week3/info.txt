What is ORM?
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using high-level programming languages, such as C#, rather than SQL. ORM frameworks like EF Core automatically map classes to tables, allowing developers to manipulate the data in the form of objects.

Benefits of ORM:

Productivity: Avoid writing complex SQL queries.

Maintainability: Code is easier to manage and refactor.

Abstraction from SQL: Developers focus on application logic rather than SQL syntax.

EF Core vs EF Framework
EF Core:

Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Lightweight and modular.

Supports modern features like LINQ, async queries, and compiled queries.

EF Framework (EF6):

Windows-only and more mature.

Less flexible compared to EF Core.

Has more features but lacks newer capabilities like cross-platform support.

EF Core 8.0 Features
JSON column mapping: Allows mapping JSON columns in SQL to C# objects.

Improved performance: Optimizations through compiled models.

Interceptors and better bulk operations: Enhanced performance and monitoring.
